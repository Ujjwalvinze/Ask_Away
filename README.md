## Guidelines to setup

There are two ways to setup the project: manually or using the Dockerfile. Read below for more details:

### Manual Setup

1. Open your local CLI -

   ```
   mkdir Ask_Away
   cd Ask_Away
   ```

2. Setup the backend code -

   **NOTE:** For Frontend Developers, if they dont want to setup the Backend Code, they can skip the Step 2, and make sure they follow the optional step mentioned in Step 4

   - Create a `.env` file and the format should be as given in `.env.example`.
   - Clone the code & install the modules-

     ```
     git clone https://github.com/Ujjwalvinze/Ask_Away
     cd Ask_Away

     npm install
     ```

   - Run the index `yarn start`.

3. Open a new CLI terminal and goto the root `Ask_Away` folder you created in the first step.
4. Setup the Frontend code -

   - Clone the code & install the modules-

     ```
     git clone https://github.com/Ujjwalvinze/Ask_Away
     cd Ask_Away/View

     yarn install
